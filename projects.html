                <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>

                <p>In the first session of the 6 month SHE{CODES} Plus journey we launched straight into HTML & CSS with no time to waste.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Through a variety of guided and self paced exercises I learnt to write semantic HTML for readability and accessibility, use developer tools for debugging, and implement responsive design.</p>
                <p></p>
                <P>HTML, CSS and some basic JS was used to build this portfolio site, and was used to style views, templates and components in three Django/React sites.</p>

                <h2>Python & JSON</h2>
                <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?autoplay=1&mute=1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Learning to work with Python and JSON data was possibly the most mind blowing and rewarding aspect of the whole course.</p>
                <p></p>
                <P>I learnt how to use PowerShell, virtual environments, and worked with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Variables, Booleans, Floats, Integers, Strings</li>
                        <li>Lists, Dictionaries</li>
                        <li>If Statements, Functions</li>
                        <li>For Loops, While Loops</li>
                        <li>The Plotly Library </li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="project-3">    
                <h2>Django & React</h2>
                <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?autoplay=1&mute=1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Using Django I built a news website allowing authors to sign up and post articles. Readers are able to browse articles by particular authors, or simply view the latest news.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This website required simple relational databased schema, as well as user authentication.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Meeting Russel Keith-Magee and hear him talk about User Authentication, really engrained into me the importance of building for users. In most cases, asking for a first name and last name is totally uncessary, and sometimes offensive.</p>
